Based on the roadmap found in the learn_md_content , generate a structured 30-day task plan for month {month_input}. Give the full 30 days detailed plan and dont't miss a single day. The last day of each week should be blank.
The output format must EXACTLY match the syntax and structure of `task.md`. Always the day 7, day 14 , day 21, day 28, day 30 should be blank. Prefer one learning academy if available.Must give five task for each day. Each task should be informative and precise manner.
